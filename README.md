<a href="https://github.com/boborama/StenoLite/releases/download/v1.0.1/StenoLite101.zip">Mobile version</a><br>
<br>
Originally a <a href="http://github.com/plover/plover">plover</a> clone; you can import/convert your plover dictionary.

#### It has the following limitations:

Windows only (XP with SP3 or newer)<br>
Currently the Gemini and Passport serial modes are untested/buggy

#### But it does have the following features:

Works with the Treal, any device with the Baron TX/TX Bolt protocol, Stentura machines over serial, and any NKRO keyboard<br>
Integrated audio recording and playback synchronized with your writing -- audio files saved as a reasonably sized .ogg<br>
Broadcast text as you create it to any device with an internet browser<br>
Built-in project viewer/editor--create and edit text in a more natural way<br>
Built-in dictionary viewer/editor<br>
Built-in dictionary look up as you type, with two search modes<br>
Comes with a simple steno tutor program<br>
Fast load times and a small RAM footprint<br>
Support for non-English stenograph keyboard layouts<br>
Push and pop commands: use a single stroke for closing quotations, parenthesis, brackets, html tags, etc.

#### Please read the manual for more details


### Upcoming Features

More bug fixes (as bugs are found)<br>

### Desired Features (but not currently under development)

Get permission to distribute the plover default dictionary<br>
Take input from only some keyboards rather than every keyboard indiscriminately.  This requires me to obtain another NKRO keyboard to test with.<br>
Support more stenograph machines (over USB where possible).  Again, requires testers and/or machines to test with.
