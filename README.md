# StenoLite

This project is a sister project to plover: http://github.com/plover/plover

### It lacks the following capabilities in comparison to plover:

Windows only (sorry)

Supports only keyboard and Treal input for the moment


###ã€€But it does have the following features:

Built in dictionary look-up as you type, with two search modes

Extremely fast load times with compiled dictionaries

Built in dictionary editor/viewer



#### Please read the manual for more details


## Upcoming Features

Project viewer: save a project as a collection of strokes; insert and delete strokes anywhere in the project; customize your dictionary on a per-project basis

##Desired Features (but not currently under development)

Get permission to distribute the plover default dictionary

Take input from only some keyboards rather than every keyboard indiscriminately.  This requires me to obtain another NKRO keyboard to test with.

Support more stenograph machines (over USB where possible).  Again, this requires me to have access to other machines to test with.
