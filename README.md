<a href="https://github.com/boborama/StenoLite/releases/download/v0.9.1-beta/StenoLite091.zip">Mobile version</a>

This project is a sister project to plover: http://github.com/plover/plover

### It lacks the following capabilities in comparison to plover:

Windows only (XP with SP3 or newer)<br>
Supports only keyboard and Treal input for the moment

### But it does have the following features:

Built in dictionary look-up as you type, with two search modes<br>
Built in project viewer/editor--create and edit text in a more natural way<br>
Extremely fast load times with compiled dictionaries<br>
Smaller RAM footprint<br>
Built in dictionary editor/viewer<br>
Support for non-English stenograph keyboard layouts<br>
Push and pop commands: use a single stroke for closing quotations, parenthesis, brackets, html tags, etc.

#### Please read the manual for more details


## Upcoming Features

Import and convert the syntax of plover commands in a dictionary file to StenoLite commands

##Desired Features (but not currently under development)

Get permission to distribute the plover default dictionary<br>
Take input from only some keyboards rather than every keyboard indiscriminately.  This requires me to obtain another NKRO keyboard to test with.<br>
Support more stenograph machines (over USB where possible).  Again, this requires me to have access to other machines to test with.
