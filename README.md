<a href="https://github.com/boborama/StenoLite/releases/download/v0.9.4-beta/StenoLite094.zip">Mobile version</a><br>
<br>
This project is a sister project to <a href="http://github.com/plover/plover">plover</a>

#### It lacks the following capabilities in comparison to plover:

Windows only (XP with SP3 or newer)<br>
Currently the Gemini, Passport, and Stentura serial modes are untested

#### But it does have the following features:

Built-in dictionary look up as you type, with two search modes<br>
Built-in project viewer/editor--create and edit text in a more natural way<br>
Built-in dictionary viewer/editor<br>
Extremely fast load times with compiled dictionaries<br>
Smaller RAM footprint<br>
Support for non-English stenograph keyboard layouts<br>
Push and pop commands: use a single stroke for closing quotations, parenthesis, brackets, html tags, etc.

#### Please read the manual for more details


### Upcoming Features

More bug fixes (as bugs are found)

### Desired Features (but not currently under development)

Get permission to distribute the plover default dictionary<br>
Take input from only some keyboards rather than every keyboard indiscriminately.  This requires me to obtain another NKRO keyboard to test with.<br>
Support more stenograph machines (over USB where possible).  Again, this requires me to have access to other machines to test with.
