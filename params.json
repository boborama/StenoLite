{"name":"Stenolite","tagline":"A free Stenograph System / Plover clone","body":"# StenoLite\r\nThis project is a sister project to plover: http://github.com/plover/plover\r\n\r\n### It lacks the following capabilities in comparison to plover:\r\n\r\nWindows only (XP with SP3 or newer)<br>\r\nSupports only keyboard and Treal input for the moment\r\n\r\n### But it does have the following features:\r\n\r\nBuilt in dictionary look-up as you type, with two search modes<br>\r\nExtremely fast load times with compiled dictionaries<br>\r\nSmaller RAM footprint<br>\r\nBuilt in dictionary editor/viewer<br>\r\nSupport for non-English stenograph keyboard layouts<br>\r\nPush and pop commands: use a single stroke for closing quotations, parenthesis, brackets, html tags, etc.\r\n\r\n#### Please read the manual for more details\r\n\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Features\r\n\r\nProject viewer: save a project as a collection of strokes; insert and delete strokes anywhere in the project; customize your dictionary on a per-project basis\r\n\r\n##Desired Features (but not currently under development)\r\n\r\nGet permission to distribute the plover default dictionary<br>\r\nTake input from only some keyboards rather than every keyboard indiscriminately.  This requires me to obtain another NKRO keyboard to test with.<br>\r\nSupport more stenograph machines (over USB where possible).  Again, this requires me to have access to other machines to test with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Please report bugs and request features","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
