To use the SLtutor application open it while StenoLite is running.

Then, open a text file from the tutor's menu.

The tutor will display the words from that text file one by one, as you type each one in the bottom box (correct answers are automatically erased).

After a moderate delay, the tutor will show the strokes that would produce this word (exactly, this is case sensitive) if it is in the currently open dictionary.
